The seat of arbitration shall be Madrid, Spain. The language of the proceedings shall be Spanish.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<br><br><br><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong><br><br>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions,&nbsp; including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
